# Course Management System
# Abstract
The Course Management System is a simple, terminal based application developed in C for managing academic course records efficiently. The system provides core functionalities including adding new course details, searching for courses by ID or name, updating existing records, and deleting entries when necessary. All course information is stored persistently in a binary .dat file, ensuring data remains available across multiple sessions. Designed for ease of use, the program offers a menu-driven interface suitable for learning basic C concepts and for managing a small course catalog. The project clearly demonstrates fundamental concepts of file handling, data structures, and control flow in C
